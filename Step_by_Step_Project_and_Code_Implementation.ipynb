    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Git Hooks Integration\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# Install once per repository\n",

    "\n",
    "# Runs automatically on every commit\n",

    "## Troubleshooting\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pre-commit Too Slow?\n",
    "```bash\n",

    "1. Ruff is the tool that does the actual linting and formatting\n",
